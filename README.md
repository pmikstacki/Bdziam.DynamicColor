# Material Color Utilities

This is a direct translation of Material Color Utilities from Java to C#

There is another package [Here](https://github.com/albi005/MaterialColorUtilities/), but Google introduced new Scheme
calculations, and added few new styles, making the MaterialColorUtilities package for .net obsolete.

# Installation
[![NuGet Version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Bdziam.DynamicColor?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nuget.org%2Fpackages%2FBdziam.DynamicColor%2F)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Bdziam.DynamicColor/)


I used some of the contents of above package, and added DynamicColor classes, which replaced the core palette.

Since this is a direct port (with some C# syntactic sugar added to replace awful Java syntax, I puked several times rewriting this) I do plan to keep it up to date when they change the theming again, but I hope that this is final version. If I overlooked the updates, just reach out - I will update the library
